Well this is a long overdue. I was planning on doing this when initially starting out with the blog, but never found a good time to do it.

Because I'm moving to Berlin in a month, I decided to take a good look in my backpack and only include what I really need, or really want to have with my at all time. This of course came as the ideal excuse to take some pictures and finally post them here!

## The backpack
My backpack is an older __Incase City__ backpack. It's a great backpack in terms of comfort (well padded), look and water resistance. I bought some cool patches and sewed those one to give it a less dull look.

The backpack itself has a 15" laptop compartment and a lot of extra pockets for keys, notebooks and cables. I rarely use it, but the bottom padding at the back has a zipper so you can store stuff there too! It's really a pity they don't make these anymore.

## What's inside?
In the past I used to carry a lot more stuff in the backpack but nowadays it comes down to this:

To me this is the everyday toolkit. I'm pretty sure once I live in Berlin for 3 months I'll probably swap some stuff out for others though.
