Ever since I got my new Retina MacBook I’ve been ignorant to installing Flash. It’s old, it’s slow and is a hassle to install. So why would you?

With YouTube stepping up their game and making HTML5 video the default, there really should not be another reason to still have Flash on your system. Why Facebook is still hanging on to Flash for it’s video’s is a riddle to me (and some other people I guess).

But when someone sends me that killer-cool video of a kid acting though I have to see it. I could go and dig into the Web Inspector and look for the non-flash source but found a much easier way!

Trick Facebook into thinking you’re browsing from mobile Safari (on an iPod or iPhone, doesn’t really matter) and the video will play like it should do by default. Go to the developer menu and pick the **Safari iOS 7 User-Agent**, the page reloads and voila!
