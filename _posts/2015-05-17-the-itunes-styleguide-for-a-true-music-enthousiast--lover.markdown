I love order and organizing stuff. As a major music fan, you can already guess how organized my iTunes library is.  
Everything is organized so well that if I need to do a search, or want a specific playlist, looking for it just takes a second.

Do you want the optimal iTunes library? Then be sure to take notice of the tips below!

### Cover Art

A picture says so much more than words.  
That’s why it is important to give every single, ep or album a cover illustration. When scrolling through covers in the Album view it becomes way easier to find a specific album. The brain remembers _visually_ more than _textually_. You can imagine I can find a specific album in a list of 20 by the same artist way quicker by looking at the cover than reading the album title.

The way I work for ep’s or albums that don’t have cover art is as follows: I look up the album art on the internet (most of the time this is via [Discogs](https://discogs.com), [Beatport](https://beatport.com) or [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com). Google Images might work sometimes) and then open the Info dialog on one or multiple tracks. Then just grab the image in your web browser en drag it over to the Illustration tab in iTunes’ Info window.

### iTunes Columns

By default iTunes formats the library layout with some pretty useless column fields. How many times I played a song or how much I’ve rated a song (I never do this) is something I almost never need to know.

I think the ideal column field layout for a music enthousiast is as follows:

Title | Time | Artist | Album | Album Artist | Genre | Year | Bitrate

This gives you practically **all the useful info you need**, when you need to examine a track or search for one. Bitrate makes it easy to take a look at the lower bitrate items you added, and might want to replace.  
_(The BPM field might also be interesting to those who are DJ’s or producers, but you’ll have to manually provide BPM’s in the Info window)_

### Taking notice of bitrates

If you’re not familiar with bitrates, the [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_rate#Multimedia) for it is something you should read.  
In general a bitrate resembles the **amount of data a track streams** in seconds (expressed in kbps). Bitrates and codecs are somewhat more technical, but the basics of it are fairly easy.

**A higher bitrate is better than a lower bitrate** (more data is being sent), but higher bitrate means **higher file size**. Bitrates are also dependent to codecs and can be two formats, CBR or VBR (Constant, e.g the track constantly transfers 320 kbps VS. Variable, e.g the data transfer changes while playing the track from 320 to lower and than back up). In general the codec most people are familiar with is MP3. MP3 is a lossy codec, meaning it loses some quality but is smaller in file size.  
**MP3 is a good standard** to get audio in but try to always get a track with a bitrate of **256 or 320 kbps**. Lower bitrates might sound less crisp.

iTunes’ and iTunes Store’s default format is an **AAC** codec called `.m4a`  
I personally prefer m4a over mp3, because it is also a lossy format but a 256 AAC track **maintains more quality than a 256 MP3 track**. I might be wrong but to me a 256 kbps AAC track sounds practically the same to its 320 MP3 equivalent.

> Bottom line: Pick whatever codec you prefer but try to obtain a quality of at least 256 kbps.

### Equalizing

Equalizing a track is something I rarely do.  
Though iTunes provides a general and track specific equalizer, most tracks don’t need them. Producers already think stuff like bass, mid and high tones trough when they are working on a track, so they are practically **equalizing it so you don’t have to**.

If you still want to equalize a track or tracks, always use manual equalization and **never use the built in presets**.  
While the Dance preset might work for your bass-filled techno track, it may sound awful for the techno track with lots of hi-hats. Keep that in mind.
And as stated by Lifehacker and other music enthousiasts, [always, always, always equalize down](https://lifehacker.com/should-i-use-an-equalizer-when-i-listen-to-music-1488713937).

### iTunes info windows

All these tips might get you thinking “_Hey this is really useful stuff_” but most of them won’t work if you don’t fill in, or know how to work the iTunes Info field.  
When I obtain a new track, the first thing I do is open the info dialog and fill the info in accordingly. Start by opening the Info window by right clicking on a track (or multiple if you’re working on an EP or album), or pressing `Cmd+I` on a Mac.

Skip the first General tab and go to the second Info one to fill in the info.  
Now, there’s a bunch of options there, but you don’t have to fill them all in. I’ve made a selection of the most useful ones which will provide clear structure and optimize searching for an item in your library.

It should be clear the **Title** and **Artist** fields are something you should always fill in. If you’re working on editing a compilation album which consists of multiple tracks by multiple artists a good rule to maintain is to fill in the specific artist for each track, and **Various Artists in the Album Artist field**. This way they will show up as one album in iTunes’ album view but still provide individual artist info per track. And please format artists the **same way** every time, don’t use Stwo on some tracks and STWO on other. This is just plain horrible when it comes to managing the library.

When it comes to the **Album** field, I tend to always copy the name of the album as it is released by the artist (look this up on iTunes Store or Beatport). EP, Single or Remixes should always be formatted as follows: _Album Title - Type_.  
For example Leave Me Alone by Kaytranada should be formatted as _Leave Me Alone - Single_ When you get the routine of doing this it will provide clearer and vaster structure for your library.

**Grouping** is something which for me is an alias to the label field.  
iTunes doesn’t provide a label field so this is where I like to fill this in. It makes it easy to find releases by a specific label in iTunes’ tracks view.

Provide good but not too detailed info for **genres**, and always provide a genre to a track. Some people may like to list subgenres like footwork, leftfield and others here but I like to give it a more general name. For example footwork and leftfield both go under the Electronic genre for me.

Always provide a year as it is easy to find a specific release by a label if you do so, or ever need to look that up

Fill in track numbers if you want to, and always fill in Disc numbers accordingly if you’re working on a multiple disc album.
This way an album won’t be split up into two separate items in iTunes’ album view.

### Wrapping up

Maintaining the above styleguide will get you around the library more quickly and clearer. It will make you a more happy music lover.
