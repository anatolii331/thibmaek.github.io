Rewriting this blog meant I wanted to do it properly myself. And of course the finishing touch that needs to be applied is a nice cross-platform icon for the website.  
I needed both a favicon and an iOS icon to be covered on iOS, Android and browsers (boo fucking hoo-you IE for only including png support in IE11).

When I searched for a webicon template for Sketch I found none that had support for all platforms. I created one myself and you can download it below.

What I came up with is a template for Sketch with support for:

- All iOS devices up to iPhone 6+ and iPad Air 2
- Android devices
- All modern browsers
- Windows 8 Tablets / PCâ€™s

### Installing in Sketch

As simple as opening the file and choosing `File > Save As Template` in Sketch.
Or drop it in `~/Library/Application Support/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3/Templates` manually.
