I’m Thibault Maekelbergh and I’m a student at [Devine](http://devine.be) in the university college of **Howest**. Here I combine both design & development to make the most kickass websites, apps and designs.

I’m passionate about all things web and love **Javascript & Devops**.  
I’m a huge nerd and love tinkering with my **Raspberry Pi’s**. My preferred social network is not Facebook nor Twitter but [Github](https://github.com/thibmaek).

Currently I'm doing an internship at **[Resin.io](https://resin.io)**, a platform that makes it easy to deploy applications to microcomputers like the Raspberry Pi.

Furthermore I am an **Apple Product Professional** and work a weekend job at [Lab9](http://lab9.be), Belgium’s biggest and best Apple Premium Reseller & Service Provider.

Besides this blog I also like to post photos on **[BEtypo](http://betypo.tumblr.com)**.  
A blog dedicated to nice typography that's located throughout the Belgian 'wilderness'.
