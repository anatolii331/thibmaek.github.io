I’m Thibault Maekelbergh and I’m a student at [Devine](http://devine.be) in the university college of **Howest**. Here I combine both design & development to make the most kickass websites, apps and designs.

I’m passionate about all things web and love **Javascript & CSS**.  
I’m a huge nerd and love tinkering with my **Raspberry Pi’s**. My preferred social network is not Facebook nor Twitter but [Github](https://github.com/thibmaek).

Furthermore I am an **Apple Product Professional** and work a weekend job at [Lab9](http://lab9.be), Belgium’s biggest and best Apple Premium Reseller & Service Provider.

Besides this blog I also like to post photos on [BEtypo](http://betypo.tumblr.com).  
A blog dedicated to nice typography that's located troughout the Belgian 'wilderness'.
