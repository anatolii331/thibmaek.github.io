I’m Thibault Maekelbergh and I’m a student at [Devine](http://devine.be) in the university college of **Howest**. Here I combine both design & development to make the most kickass websites, apps and designs.

I’m passionate about all things web and love **Javascript & Devops**.  
I’m a huge nerd and love tinkering with my **Raspberry Pi’s**. My preferred social network is not Facebook nor Twitter but [Github](https://github.com/thibmaek).

I previously freelanced at **[Resin.io](https://resin.io)** and currently I'm working at [Typework](http://typework.com) as a frontend React developer.

Besides this blog I also like to post photos on **[BEtypo](http://betypo.tumblr.com)**.  
A blog dedicated to nice typography that's located throughout the Belgian 'wilderness'.
