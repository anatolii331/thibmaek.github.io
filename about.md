**Alumni [Devine](https://devine.be)** 2017.

I can't stop learning new stuff. Docker, Redux, AWS Lambda, RollupJS, Python, it all interests me! Making and doing things with code is my long time passion aside from digging trough record crates trying to find some nice records for my ever growing collection.

Javascript is my goto language but that doesn't scare me off from experimenting with Go, Elm or Haskell. I have a humongous  appetite for anything devops related (looking at you Docker!) and IoT.
I own 5 Raspberry Pi's with whom I've gone trough a difficult, yet loving relationship with.
Oh and I check [my Github](https://github.com/thibmaek) like 20 times a day.

I previously freelanced at **[Resin.io](https://resin.io)** and **[NephroFlow](https://nephroflow.com/)**, interned at **[Edenspiekermann](https://edenspiekermann.com)** in Berlin, and currently work at **[In The Pocket](https://inthepocket.mobi)**.

Besides this blog I also like to post photos on **[BEtypo](https://instagram.com/be.typo)**.  
A blog dedicated to nice typography that's located throughout the Belgian 'wilderness'.
